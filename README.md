# ISStracker
 This program tracks the ISS and sends you an email when it is over you, so you can look up and see it. This is done by using 2 API'S. The first one being the ISS Now API to track the ISS's location and the second one being the open weather API to check if it is actually night and possible for you to see the space station.
 
 If you want to use this project yourself you just have to enter your email, email password and your longitude and latitude.
